* .emacs.d

!!! This is broken!
!!! Mostly the folder struckture from me moving to neovim.
!!! Will update it to a working setup for the future!

This is just my emacs conf.

** elisp/
Here is amongst other things my machine-specific settings, including the publish settings for my homepage and my org-captures.

* Folders if you clone this without change (not recommended)

org-files goes in ~/org/

todos for org capture goes in ~/org/toDo/

org-roam files goes in ~/org/zettelKasten/

monthly journal goes in ~/org/zettelKasten/journal/

org-roam dailys goes in ~/org/zettelKasten/daily/

* Worth while settings outside emacs

setxkbmap -option ctrl:nocaps

OR

setxkbmap -option ctrl:swapcaps

TO DISABLE: 

setxkbmap -option

* Vertico, Marginalia, Consult, Embark, Orderless

Trying out these packages! Said to be the best alternative!
