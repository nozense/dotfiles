# .vim

## Installation

Should work mostly out of the box, BUT...

I use vim-plug https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug

So, run ':PlugInstall' after you've cloned the repo to download the packages!

## Local settings

I put my local settings in the file .vim/local.vimrc  <- That file is git ignored.

If you want to add your own settings just create and edit that file
(~/.vim/local.vimrc).
